    - Understand the role of each technology component in the project.

2. **Containerization with Docker**
    - Learn the basics of Docker and containerization.
    - Practice creating Docker images and running containers locally.

## Task 4: Version Control and Collaboration

1. **Git Version Control**
    - Review Git basics: cloning repositories, branching, committing changes.
    - Understand the project's branching strategy and Git workflow (feature branches, pull requests).

2. **Collaboration Tools**
    - Explore collaboration tools used by the team (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    - Participate in code reviews and learn about team communication channels.

## Task 5: Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Unit Testing**
    - Learn how to write and execute unit tests using JUnit or TestNG.
    - Understand the importance of test-driven development (TDD) in microservices.

2. **Integration and End-to-End Testing**
    - Explore strategies for testing microservices interactions.
    - Set up integration testing frameworks (e.g., Mockito, WireMock).

## Task 6: Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

1. **CI/CD Pipelines**
    - Learn about CI/CD pipelines and their role in automating builds, tests, and deployments.
    - Configure and run basic CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Azure DevOps.

2. **Deployment Strategies**
    - Understand deployment strategies such as blue-green deployments and canary releases.
    - Practice deploying microservices to development and staging environments.

## Task 7: Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Monitoring Tools**
    - Explore monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) used for tracking microservices performance metrics.
    - Set up monitoring dashboards and alerts for key metrics.

2. **Logging and Error Handling**
    - Learn best practices for logging in microservices applications.
    - Understand error handling strategies and practices for debugging.

## Task 8: Security and Compliance

1. **Security Best Practices**
    - Study principles of secure microservices architecture (authentication, authorization, encryption).
    - Review compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS) relevant to the project.

2. **Data Privacy and Protection**
    - Understand how to handle sensitive data securely within microservices.
    - Implement encryption and data masking techniques where applicable.
